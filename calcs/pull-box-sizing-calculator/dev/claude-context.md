### Session 2: 2025-07-16
**Session Duration**: Extended session  
**Session Type**: Bug fixes and feature development

#### Activities Completed:
1. **Bug Investigation**: Analyzed zoom behavior differences between 3D and orthogonal view modes
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Discovered that 3D mode uses dynamic controls.enabled toggling based on mouse hover detection
3. **Code Fix**: Applied same hover-based controls.enabled logic to orthogonal mode for consistent zoom behavior

#### Key Findings:
- 3D mode (solid/wireframe) was working correctly due to controls.enabled being toggled based on shape hover detection
- Orthogonal mode was missing the controls.enabled logic, causing zoom to work anywhere in canvas
- Both modes actually had controls.enableZoom = true, but 3D mode's dynamic controls.enabled was the differentiator
- Existing raycasting and cursor detection was already implemented, just needed controls enabling/disabling

#### Decisions Made:
- Fixed orthogonal mode by adding controls.enabled = true/false based on shape hover detection
- Maintained existing 3D mode behavior as it was working perfectly
- Used same raycasting approach as 3D mode for consistency

#### Session Outcome:
- Zoom now works identically in all view modes: only when hovering directly over 3D shape
- Page scroll works properly when hovering over empty canvas space
- User reported fix works correctly and requested commit and push

### Session 3: 2025-07-16
**Session Duration**: Extended session  
**Session Type**: Feature development and framework implementation

#### Activities Completed:
1. **Simple Mode Framework**: Implemented configurable pulls management for simple interface mode
2. **Feature Flag System**: Created simpleModeFeatures configuration object to control feature visibility independently
3. **Mode-Aware Functions**: Modified addPull(), toggleConductorSize(), and updatePullsTable() to work with both advanced and simple modes
4. **UI Integration**: Added complete pulls management interface to simple mode with feature-based column hiding

#### Key Findings:
- Successfully implemented single codebase approach where advanced mode shows all features and simple mode uses configurable flags
- Simple mode can now independently control feature visibility without affecting advanced mode functionality
- Conductor size toggle functionality needed to be made mode-aware to work properly in simple interface
- Data synchronization works correctly between both interface modes

#### Decisions Made:
- Used CSS classes and feature flags for dynamic column hiding in simple mode
- Maintained shared data model (pulls array) between both interfaces for consistency
- Implemented mode parameter system for existing functions rather than duplicating code
- Added automatic feature styling application when switching modes and updating tables

#### Session Outcome:
- Simple mode now has fully functional pulls management with configurable features
- Framework allows easy addition of new features that automatically appear in advanced mode
- Simple mode feature visibility can be controlled through simpleModeFeatures configuration object
- All existing functionality preserved in advanced mode, simple mode operates independently

### Session 4: 2025-07-17
**Session Duration**: Extended session  
**Session Type**: Auto-resize feature implementation and 3D rendering bug fixes

#### Activities Completed:
1. **Parallel/Non-parallel Toggle**: Added calculation method toggle to simple mode Box Dimensions section with two-way synchronization
2. **Auto-resize Implementation**: Implemented automatic box resizing to minimum dimensions when adding pulls in simple mode
3. **Auto-arrange Integration**: Added automatic conduit arrangement when pulls are added in simple mode
4. **Critical 3D Rendering Bug Fix**: Fixed fundamental issue where 3D box disappeared during any dimension changes in simple mode

#### Key Findings:
- Simple mode auto-resize was initially implemented but caused 3D box to disappear
- Root cause analysis revealed hardcoded references to 'canvas-holder' in camera calculation functions
- When in simple mode, canvas is actually in 'simple-canvas-holder' but functions were reading wrong container dimensions
- This caused incorrect camera positioning and made box appear to disappear
- Issue affected both manual dimension changes and auto-resize in simple mode

#### Technical Implementation:
- Added `syncCalcMethodToggles()` function for parallel/non-parallel toggle synchronization
- Created `autoResizeAndArrangeForSimpleMode()` and `setToMinimumDimensionsForSimpleMode()` functions
- Implemented `getActiveCanvasHolder()` helper function to detect current interface mode
- Fixed hardcoded canvas references in `switchToOrthogonalView()`, `switchTo3DView()`, and `initThreeJS()`

#### Decisions Made:
- Used same calculation logic as advanced mode's "Set to Minimum Dimensions" button for consistency
- Implemented comprehensive debugging to identify the rendering issue through console logging
- Applied canvas holder detection to ensure camera calculations use correct container dimensions
- Maintained backward compatibility with advanced mode functionality

#### Session Outcome:
- Simple mode now automatically resizes box to minimum dimensions and arranges conduits when pulls are added
- Parallel/non-parallel calculation toggle works in both modes with proper synchronization
- Fixed fundamental 3D rendering issue that affected all dimension changes in simple mode
- Simple mode now provides fully automated experience while maintaining advanced mode's manual control options

### Session 5: 2025-07-17
**Session Duration**: Extended session
**Session Type**: Complete simple mode automation and conduit orientation preparation

#### Activities Completed:
1. **Conduit Orientation Foundation**: Prepared codebase for parallel vs non-parallel conduit organization differentiation
2. **Auto-resize on Toggle Change**: Implemented automatic box resizing when parallel/non-parallel toggle changes in simple mode
3. **Auto-resize on Conduit Removal**: Added automatic box resizing when conduits are removed in simple mode
4. **Complete Simple Mode Automation**: Simple mode now automatically handles all sizing and arrangement tasks

#### Key Findings:
- Existing `autoArrangeConduits()` function was well-structured for adding mode differentiation
- All optimization functions needed mode parameter to support different orientation logic
- Toggle changes can affect minimum dimensions requiring automatic adjustment in simple mode
- Conduit removal also affects minimum dimensions and should trigger auto-resize for consistency

#### Technical Implementation:
- Enhanced `autoArrangeConduits()` with parallel/non-parallel mode detection
- Updated all optimization function signatures to accept `isParallelMode` parameter
- Created `handleSimpleModeToggleChange()` for smart toggle handling in simple mode only
- Added `isCurrentlyInSimpleMode()` helper function for mode detection
- Modified `removePull()` to trigger auto-resize in simple mode
- Maintained separate handlers for advanced vs simple mode toggles

#### Decisions Made:
- Prepared infrastructure for future conduit orientation differentiation without changing current behavior
- Simple mode toggle uses smart handler that detects dimension changes before auto-resizing
- Advanced mode toggle remains unchanged to preserve manual control
- Used consistent timing patterns (setTimeout) for proper calculation sequencing
- Added comprehensive console logging for debugging and verification

#### Session Outcome:
- Simple mode now provides complete automation for all user actions (add, remove, toggle)
- Advanced mode maintains full manual control with no behavioral changes
- Codebase prepared for implementing different conduit organization strategies based on calculation mode
- All optimization functions ready to receive parallel/non-parallel mode information
- Foundation established for future conduit orientation logic implementation

### Session 6: 2025-07-17
**Session Duration**: Extended session
**Session Type**: Bug fixes for U-pull calculation issues

#### Activities Completed:
1. **Debug Analysis**: Investigated top/top and bottom/bottom U-pull calculation bugs reported by user
2. **Parallel vs Non-parallel Logic**: Fixed calculation formulas to properly respect calculation mode setting
3. **Step Logic Corrections**: Corrected which calculation steps should be used for width vs height comparisons
4. **Rear U-pull Height Consistency**: Standardized rear U-pull height calculations between Step 21 and Step 21a

#### Key Findings:
- Step 17 (U-pull spacing width) was always using parallel calculation regardless of mode setting
- Step 20 (width comparison) was incorrectly using Step 17 values instead of Step 19 values
- Step 21 and Step 21a were using different rear U-pull height calculations (63.375" vs 22.5")
- "Rear U-Pull Height" was incorrectly including top/bottom wall calculations for non-rear pulls

#### Technical Implementation:
- Added `isParallelMode` detection in `calculatePullBox()` function with comprehensive debug logging
- Updated Step 17 and Step 18a with mode-specific calculation formulas:
  - **Parallel mode**: Uses full lockring spacing calculations
  - **Non-parallel mode**: Uses traditional NEC calculation (6×largest + sum of conduits - largest)
- Fixed Step 20 width comparison to use `widthUPullSpacingOption1` from Step 19 instead of Step 17
- Updated Step 21 to use `rearUPullHeightAlt` (22.5") for consistency with Step 21a
- Separated Step 19 logic to distinguish between top/bottom wall calculations and actual rear U-pulls

#### Decisions Made:
- Maintained Step 19b calculation code for potential future use elsewhere
- Used dynamic display names showing current calculation mode (parallel/non-parallel)
- Applied same mode-specific logic to both width and height U-pull calculations
- Preserved existing calculation structure while fixing the logic flow

#### Session Outcome:
- Top/top and bottom/bottom U-pull calculations now show correct values based on calculation mode
- Non-parallel mode shows ~52.125" for pull distance instead of incorrect parallel values
- "Rear U-Pull Height" only appears for actual rear-to-rear U-pulls, not top/bottom pulls
- Both Step 21 and Step 21a now use consistent rear U-pull height calculations
- Comprehensive debug output helps identify calculation mode and step-by-step values

### Session 7: 2025-07-17
**Session Duration**: Extended session
**Session Type**: Auto-arrange differentiation and crossing arrangement implementation

#### Activities Completed:
1. **Label Corrections**: Fixed HTML switch labels to correctly show Parallel/Non-parallel positions
2. **Crossing Arrangement Logic**: Implemented crossing conduit arrangement for side-to-side angle pulls when switch is OFF
3. **Auto-arrange Differentiation**: Added different arrangement strategies based on parallel/non-parallel switch position
4. **Comprehensive Function Enhancement**: Created new `getClusteredPositionsCrossing()` function for crossing behavior

#### Key Findings:
- HTML labels were backwards - switch ON showed "Non-parallel" but used parallel calculations
- User wanted crossing arrangement (conduits cross each other) when switch is OFF
- Original nested arrangement should be preserved when switch is ON
- Crossing logic requires reversing exit wall index while maintaining entry wall order

#### Technical Implementation:
- Fixed HTML labels in both advanced and simple mode interfaces
- Enhanced `clusterAnglePullGroup()` to handle both arrangement modes based on `isParallelMode`
- Created `getClusteredPositionsCrossing()` function implementing crossing pattern:
  - Entry wall uses normal index (0, 1, 2, 3...)
  - Exit wall uses reversed index (3, 2, 1, 0...)
  - Maintains tight clustering with locknutODSpacing for maximum raceway distances
- Added comprehensive console logging for debugging crossing behavior
- Updated `optimizeAnglePullsWithClustering()` to pass `isParallelMode` parameter

#### Decisions Made:
- Switch OFF (isParallelMode = false): Uses crossing arrangement for side-to-side angle pulls
- Switch ON (isParallelMode = true): Uses original nested arrangement (unchanged)
- Preserved all existing tight clustering logic for maximum distance optimization
- Applied crossing logic to all 8 side-to-side angle pull combinations (left/top, top/right, etc.)

#### Session Outcome:
- Side-to-side angle pulls now cross each other when switch is OFF while maintaining tight clustering
- Original nested behavior preserved when switch is ON
- HTML labels now correctly reflect calculation modes
- Foundation established for implementing similar logic for side-to-side U-pulls
- Ready to implement crossing arrangement for remaining pull types

### Session 8: 2025-07-17
**Session Duration**: Extended session
**Session Type**: Side-to-side U-pulls crossing arrangement completion and app defaults

#### Activities Completed:
1. **Crossing Arrangement for Side-to-Side U-pulls**: Implemented crossing conduit arrangement for side-to-side U-pulls when switch is OFF
2. **Canvas Initialization Fixes**: Fixed 3D rendering and ViewCube issues when app loads in simple mode
3. **Simple Mode as Default**: Changed app to open in simple mode by default for better user experience
4. **Branch Management**: Merged completed feature branch back to main branch

#### Key Findings:
- Initial crossing logic for U-pulls was creating compressed arrangement instead of true crossing
- Canvas and ViewCube initialization was hardcoded to advanced mode containers
- App needed to default to simple mode for better user experience
- Both main canvas and ViewCube needed proper container detection for initialization

#### Technical Implementation:
- Enhanced `optimizeSidewallUPullsWithSpreadStrategy()` to handle parallel vs non-parallel modes
- Created `spreadUPullsOnWallCrossing()` function implementing true crossing pattern:
  - Entry positions use normal index starting from one extreme
  - Exit positions use reversed index starting from opposite extreme
  - Creates diagonal crossing pattern where conduits cross each other
- Fixed canvas initialization to use `getActiveCanvasHolder()` instead of hardcoded container
- Fixed ViewCube initialization to use `getActiveCanvasHolder()` for proper container detection
- Updated HTML interface toggle to have `checked` attribute for simple mode default
- Updated interface visibility classes to show simple mode and hide advanced mode by default

#### Decisions Made:
- Switch OFF (isParallelMode = false): Uses crossing arrangement for both angle pulls and U-pulls
- Switch ON (isParallelMode = true): Uses original nested/converging arrangements (unchanged)
- Simple mode as default provides better initial user experience
- Preserved all existing tight clustering logic for maximum distance optimization
- Applied crossing logic to all sidewall U-pull combinations (left/left, right/right, top/top, bottom/bottom)

#### Session Outcome:
- Complete auto-arrange differentiation feature implemented for both angle pulls and U-pulls
- True crossing patterns create realistic diagonal conduit arrangements in non-parallel mode
- App opens in simple mode by default with proper 3D rendering and ViewCube display
- Original nested behavior preserved when switch is ON (parallel mode)
- Feature branch successfully merged to main branch and deployed
- All canvas initialization issues resolved for both interface modes

### Session 9: 2025-07-17
**Session Duration**: Extended session
**Session Type**: Parallel mode U-pull calculation refinement and optimization

#### Activities Completed:
1. **Side-to-Side U-Pull Analysis**: Deep analysis of Steps 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 calculations for parallel mode optimization
2. **Steps 18 & 19 Formula Refinement**: Modified calculation formula to reduce oversizing for clustered U-pull arrangements
3. **New Steps 8a-11a Implementation**: Added U-pull specific lockring calculations for more accurate box sizing
4. **Final Comparison Integration**: Integrated new steps into Step 20/21 and 20a/21a final comparisons

#### Key Findings:
- Steps 18 & 19 were oversizing boxes due to formula: `6×largest + (sum of locknut ODs × 2) - largest locknut OD`
- Current formula resulted in wasteful spacing: 3 × 4" conduits gave ~31.5" distance (only need 24")
- Steps 15 & 16 were not the primary issue but were correctly enforcing code minimums
- No mode-awareness issue - system was already properly differentiating parallel vs non-parallel modes
- Missing U-pull specific lockring calculations for walls with only U-pulls

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Modified Steps 18 & 19 formula** from `sixTimesLargest + (totalLocknutSpacing × 2) - largestLocknutOD` to `sixTimesLargest + totalLocknutSpacing + largestLocknutOD`
- **New Step 8a**: Left Wall U-Pull Lockring Height = `sum of left/left U-pull locknut ODs × 2`
- **New Step 9a**: Right Wall U-Pull Lockring Height = `sum of right/right U-pull locknut ODs × 2`
- **New Step 10a**: Top Wall U-Pull Lockring Width = `sum of top/top U-pull locknut ODs × 2`
- **New Step 11a**: Bottom Wall U-Pull Lockring Width = `sum of bottom/bottom U-pull locknut ODs × 2`
- **Integration**: Added Steps 8a/9a to height comparisons (Steps 21/21a), Steps 10a/11a to width comparisons (Steps 20/20a)
- **Updated debug logging** to reflect new calculation methods

#### Calculation Results Improvement:
**For 3 × 4" left/left U-pulls:**
- **Before**: Step 18 = 52.125" (distance ~31.5" - wasteful)
- **After**: Step 18 = 46.5" (more reasonable sizing)
- **Step 8a**: 33.75" (U-pull specific lockring requirement)

**Formula Logic:**
- `sixTimesLargest (24")` - Base NEC requirement
- `+ totalLocknutSpacing (16.875")` - Space for all conduit locknut ODs once
- `+ largestLocknutOD (5.625")` - Additional space for largest conduit
- **× 2 factor removed** - eliminates double-counting of spacing

#### Decisions Made:
- Preserved all existing calculations unchanged - new steps are additional options only
- Used Math.max() approach in final comparisons to let best calculation win
- Applied cluster-aware spacing that better reflects actual conduit arrangements
- Maintained NEC compliance while reducing oversizing for multiple U-pull scenarios

#### Session Outcome:
- More efficient box sizing for multiple side-to-side U-pulls while maintaining code compliance
- New U-pull specific lockring calculations provide additional optimization opportunities
- Refined calculations reduce material waste without compromising electrical safety
- System now properly accounts for clustered U-pull arrangements in final sizing decisions
- Ready for testing and validation of improved U-pull calculations

### Session 10: 2025-07-18
**Session Duration**: Extended session
**Session Type**: Variable naming fixes and simple mode UX improvements

#### Activities Completed:
1. **Variable Naming Correction**: Fixed counterintuitive `isParallelMode` boolean logic and HTML labels
2. **Side-to-Side Pull Investigation**: Analyzed auto-arrange logic and overlap issues between geometrically equivalent pulls
3. **Simple Mode UX Enhancement**: Implemented simplified orientation dropdown to replace dual entry/exit dropdowns
4. **Overlap Solution**: Eliminated duplicate orientation combinations that caused auto-arrange conflicts

#### Key Findings:
- `isParallelMode` variable naming was backwards causing confusion throughout development
- Side-to-side angle pulls (left/top vs top/left) were grouped separately causing overlaps
- Straight pulls work fine because they group by axis, but angle pulls group by exact combination
- User experience in simple mode was unnecessarily complex with separate entry/exit dropdowns

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Boolean Logic Fix**: Flipped `isParallelMode = !(toggleValue)` so variable name matches behavior
- **HTML Label Correction**: Swapped toggle labels so they correctly indicate mode states
- **Simplified Orientation Dropdown**: Created single dropdown with 15 predefined orientations:
  - 2 straight pulls (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
  - 4 angle pulls (left-to-top, left-to-bottom, right-to-top, right-to-bottom)
  - 4 rear angles (left-to-rear, right-to-rear, top-to-rear, bottom-to-rear)
  - 4 U-pulls (left-to-left, right-to-right, top-to-top, bottom-to-bottom)
  - 1 rear U-pull (rear-to-rear)
- **Function Updates**: Modified `addPull()`, `toggleConductorSize()`, and `updatePullsTable()` for orientation parsing
- **Display Helper**: Created `getOrientationDisplay()` function for human-readable table formatting

#### Problem Analysis:
- **Root Cause**: `optimizeAnglePullsWithClustering()` groups pulls by exact entry-exit combination
- **Overlap Mechanism**: `left-top` and `top-left` become separate groups that can claim same physical space
- **Solution Approach**: Eliminate duplicate combinations at UI level rather than complex grouping logic changes

#### Decisions Made:
- Fixed variable naming for long-term code maintainability
- Chose UI-level solution over complex auto-arrange modifications
- Organized orientations by type (STRAIGHT, ANGLE, REAR, U-PULL) for better UX
- Maintained advanced mode unchanged for users who need full flexibility
- Used categorized dropdown labels for clarity

#### Session Outcome:
- Variable naming now intuitive: `isParallelMode = true` means parallel mode
- Simple mode eliminates duplicate orientations that caused overlap issues
- Improved user experience with single categorized orientation dropdown
- Advanced mode retains full flexibility for complex scenarios
- Foundation established for eliminating auto-arrange conflicts through better UI design

### Session 11: 2025-07-18
**Session Duration**: Extended session  
**Session Type**: Complex Pull Management Foundation (Phase 2.1)

#### Activities Completed:
1. **Phase 2.1 Foundation**: Implemented complete complex pull management foundation
2. **Clean Architecture**: Established minimal integration between script.js and ComplexPullManager
3. **Priority System**: Created comprehensive priority classification (P1-P5) 
4. **Critical Revert**: Successfully reverted from heavy script.js modifications to maintain clean codebase

#### Key Technical Accomplishments:
- **Created complex-pull-manager.js**: Complete file with WallZone class, ComplexPullManager class, and priority classification system
- **Step 0 Logic**: Added `classifyAllPulls()` detection in `autoArrangeConduits()` 
- **Clean Integration**: Script.js calls ComplexPullManager only for complex scenarios (multiple priorities), falls back to existing logic for simple scenarios
- **Priority Classification**: P1=U-pulls, P2=angles, P3=straights, P4=rear, P5=rear U-pulls

#### Critical Lessons Learned:
- **ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLE**: Keep script.js minimal, put complex logic in separate files
- Heavy modifications to script.js created maintenance nightmare and broke functionality
- Clean integration with isolated ComplexPullManager is the correct approach
- Simple scenarios should continue using existing, working logic

#### Current Implementation Status:
- **Phase 2.1**: ✅ COMPLETED - Foundation and Step 0 detection working
- **Phase 2.2**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS - Need to implement P1+P2 coordination in ComplexPullManager
- **Next Goal**: Fix P1 (U-pull) + P2 (angle pull) overlap bug by implementing proper coordination in ComplexPullManager

#### Code State:
- Clean reset to commit `6838caf` (original clean integration)
- Complex-pull-manager.js ready for MVP P1+P2 coordination development
- Script.js maintained minimal changes (only Step 0 + ComplexPullManager call)
- All complex logic development should happen in complex-pull-manager.js going forward
