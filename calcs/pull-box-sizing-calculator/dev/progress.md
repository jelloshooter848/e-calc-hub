## Current Roadmap

### Major Feature Development (2025-Q3)

- [ ] Extend conduit object model to include layer assignment
- [ ] Create layer management functions (add/remove/reorder layers)
- [ ] Update localStorage persistence to handle layer data

**Phase 1.3: NEC Calculation Updates**
- [ ] Extend box depth calculations for multi-layer scenarios
- [ ] Implement layer spacing validation (minimum clearances)
- [ ] Update pull distance calculations to account for layer depth
- [ ] Add layer-specific lockring and accessibility calculations

**Phase 1.4: 3D Visualization**
- [ ] Implement Z-axis positioning for conduits in Three.js scene

- [ ] Implement layer-aware conduit positioning algorithms
- [ ] Add conflict resolution for layer assignments
- [ ] Create layer balancing strategies

#### Phase 2: Complex Mixed Pull Arrangements (Priority-Based System)
**Objective**: Implement decision tree-based complex pull management to eliminate overlaps and optimize arrangements

**Phase 2.1: Foundation & Step 0 Implementation** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Create `complex-pull-manager.js` file structure
- [x] Implement priority classification system (`classifyPullByPriority()`, `classifyAllPulls()`)
- [x] Add Step 0 logic to main `autoArrangeConduits()` function
- [x] Create basic integration points and fallback to existing logic
- [x] Test Step 0 detection with various pull combinations
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Maintain clean architecture - script.js minimal, ComplexPullManager isolated

**Phase 2.2: Core Data Structures & MVP** üîÑ **IN PROGRESS**
- [ ] Implement `WallZone` class for tracking occupied wall space - **NEXT**
- [ ] Create basic `ComplexPullManager` class with constructor and setup - **NEXT**
- [ ] Implement Priority 1 arrangement (side-to-side U-pulls) - **NEXT**
- [ ] Implement Priority 2 arrangement (side-to-side angle pulls) - **NEXT**
- [ ] Add P1+P2 coordination logic to eliminate current overlap bug - **PRIMARY GOAL**

**Phase 2.3: Wall Sharing & Coordination**
- [ ] Implement wall sharing detection functions
- [ ] Create symmetric arrangement algorithms for shared walls
- [ ] Add "push away from P1/P2" positioning logic
- [ ] Implement lockring overlap prevention validation
- [ ] Test P1+P2 scenarios thoroughly to confirm bug fix

**Phase 2.4: Priority 3-5 Implementation**
- [ ] Implement Priority 3 arrangement (straight pulls)
- [ ] Add Priority 3 coordination with P1+P2 combinations
- [ ] Implement Priority 4 arrangement (side-to-rear pulls)
- [ ] Implement Priority 5 arrangement (rear-to-rear U-pulls)
- [ ] Add complex multi-priority coordination (P1+P2+P3, etc.)

**Phase 2.5: Advanced Coordination & Edge Cases**
- [ ] Implement "center on wall" positioning for lower priorities
- [ ] Add "nest alongside" logic for multiple priority combinations
- [ ] Create space validation and overflow handling
- [ ] Add fallback strategies when optimal arrangement isn't possible
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery

**Phase 2.6: Integration & Testing**
- [ ] Complete 3D scene integration (`applyComplexArrangementTo3D()`)
- [ ] Add console debugging and arrangement visualization
- [ ] Test all priority combinations systematically
- [ ] Validate NEC compliance for complex arrangements
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization

**Phase 2.7: Documentation & Polish**
- [ ] Add comprehensive code documentation
- [ ] Create usage examples and test scenarios
- [ ] Update user-facing documentation
- [ ] Add configuration options for arrangement strategies
- [ ] Final testing and edge case validation

### Current Session Priorities
1. **Phase 2.2** - Implement MVP P1+P2 coordination in ComplexPullManager to fix overlap bug
2. Focus ALL complex logic development in complex-pull-manager.js (not script.js)
3. Test P1 (left-to-left U-pull) + P2 (left-to-top angle pull) coordination
4. Complete Priority 1 and Priority 2 arrangement functions

### Upcoming Milestones
- **Phase 2.2 completion** - 2025-07-25 (MVP P1+P2 coordination, fixes overlap bug)
- **Phase 2.3 completion** - 2025-08-08 (Wall sharing logic)
- **Phase 2.4 completion** - 2025-08-15 (Priority 3-5 implementation)
- **Phase 2.5-2.7 completion** - 2025-08-31 (Full complex pull system)
- Phase 1.1 completion - 2025-09-15 (Z-Plane Layers - deferred)

### Issues to Address
- **CRITICAL**: Priority 1 + Priority 2 pulls overlap in auto-arrange (side-to-side U-pulls + angle pulls)
- Need priority-based arrangement system for complex pull scenarios
- Current auto-arrange treats each pull type separately, causing overlaps on shared walls
- Complex pull coordination requires wall zone tracking and lockring overlap prevention
- Current system assumes single-layer conduit placement (Z-plane layers needed)
- Auto-arrange algorithms need 3D spatial awareness for layering
- NEC calculations may need updates for complex scenarios
- UI complexity will increase significantly with new features

## Implementation Notes

### Code Architecture
Modular JavaScript architecture with separate functions for 3D scene management, NEC calculations, UI interactions, and data persistence. Three.js scene initialized once with efficient object updates for real-time interaction.

### Key Functions/Components
- `initThreeJS()`: Scene, camera, and renderer initialization
- `calculateMinimumDimensions()`: NEC Article 314.28 compliance calculations
- `updatePullsTable()`: DOM manipulation for pull management interface
- `savePullsToStorage()`: LocalStorage data persistence

### Database Schema (if applicable)
No database - client-side localStorage stores JSON configuration objects containing pulls array and box dimensions.

### Testing Strategy
Manual testing across browsers with focus on WebGL compatibility, responsive design validation, and NEC calculation accuracy verification.
