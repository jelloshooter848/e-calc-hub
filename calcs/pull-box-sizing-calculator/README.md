A web-based 3D visualization tool for calculating electrical pull box dimensions according to NEC Article 314.28. This interactive calculator helps electricians and engineers determine the minimum required dimensions for junction and pull boxes based on conduit sizes and pull configurations.

## Features

### 3D Visualization
- **Interactive 3D Model**: Real-time 3D representation of the pull box with conduits
- **Draggable Cylinders**: Click and drag conduit entry/exit points to reposition them on any wall
- **ViewCube Navigation**: Industry-standard 3D navigation control for easy viewing angles
- **Zoom Controls**: Smooth zoom in/out functionality
- **Wireframe Mode**: Toggle between solid and wireframe view
- **Labels Toggle**: Show/hide dimension and pull labels

### Calculation Features
- **NEC Compliant**: Automatically calculates minimum box dimensions per NEC Article 314.28
- **Pull Types Supported**:
  - Straight pulls (8x largest conduit)
  - Angle pulls (6x largest conduit + sum of remaining)
  - U-pulls (same wall entry/exit)
  - Rear wall pulls with conductor size requirements
- **Real-time Updates**: Dimensions update automatically as you modify pulls
- **Minimum Distance Display**: Shows edge-to-edge distance between conduits

### User Interface
- **Pulls Management Table**: 
  - Add/remove pulls easily
  - View all pull configurations at a glance
  - See minimum distances for each pull
  - Alternating row colors for better readability
- **Box Dimension Controls**: Adjust width, height, and depth with immediate visual feedback
- **Warning System**: Alerts when box dimensions don't meet NEC requirements
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Usage

### Adding Pulls
1. Select entry and exit sides from the dropdown menus
2. Choose conduit size (1/2" to 6")
3. For rear wall pulls, select conductor size
4. Click "Add" to create the pull

### Interacting with the 3D View
- **Rotate**: Click and drag on the canvas to rotate the view
- **Zoom**: Use the + and - buttons or scroll wheel
- **ViewCube**: Click on faces, edges, or corners for preset views
- **Drag Cylinders**: Click and drag any cylinder to reposition it on its wall
- **Distance Mode**: Click the ruler icon to toggle straight-line distance visualization

### Understanding the Display
- **Green/Blue Wires**: Show the path of pulls through the box
- **Red Circles**: Indicate the outside diameter of conduits
- **Box Dimensions**: Displayed in the results section
- **Warnings**: Red alerts indicate when dimensions don't meet code

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **Three.js**: 3D graphics and visualization
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling and responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Core functionality
- **HTML5 Canvas**: 3D rendering
- **LocalStorage**: Persistent data storage

### Browser Requirements
- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge (latest versions)
- JavaScript must be enabled

### Data Persistence
- All pulls and box dimensions are saved automatically
- Data persists between browser sessions
- Clear all data with the "Clear All Pulls" button

## NEC Compliance

This calculator implements the sizing requirements from NEC Article 314.28:

### Straight Pulls
- Minimum length = 8 times the trade size of the largest conduit

### Angle and U-Pulls
- Minimum distance = 6 times the largest conduit + sum of all other conduits on the same wall

### Conductor Fill
- For pulls involving the rear wall, conductor size must be specified
- Minimum depth is calculated based on conductor bending radius requirements
